    <h1>Prion</h1>
    <p><strong>Prion</strong> is a protein-like substance discovered across the universe, manifesting in different densities, forms, and varieties. Though its biochemical structure is not universally agreed upon, its properties remain remarkably consistent in one key aspect: its innate connection to magical phenomena.</p>

    <p>Across regions of space-time, Prion serves as the energetic and metaphysical fuel for what is commonly recognized as “magic.” It enables individuals and species to perform feats and manipulations that defy conventional physical limitations. In essence, Prion bridges the gap between the biological and the arcane.</p>

    <h2>Biological Dependency</h2>
    <p>Prion interacts most effectively with organic matter. Only biologically organic beings—especially those with intricate neural or cellular architecture—can harness Prion to its full extent. This has positioned Prion-utilizing species at the forefront of magical evolution.</p>

    <p>Experimental attempts to interface Prion with artificial intelligence, lithoid organisms, or mechanical bodies have yielded only partial or fleeting success. Such efforts are still under investigation, often resulting in unstable or unreliable outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Regional Variation</h2>
    <p>Not all Prion is created equal. Variants of Prion exist throughout different galactic sectors, and these variants influence what forms of magic are achievable. Some space-time regions allow teleportation or psionics, while others suppress such abilities entirely due to the nature of the local Prion field.</p>

    <p>This variability gives rise to entire cultures and civilizations adapted to their unique Prionic environments. Magic in one star system may manifest as elemental manipulation, while in another it may be restricted to sensory enhancement or mental projection.</p>

    <p>Understanding the origins, mutations, and fields of Prion is crucial for interstellar diplomacy, warfare, and research. The mystery of Prion continues to inspire awe—and fear—throughout the cosmos.</p>
